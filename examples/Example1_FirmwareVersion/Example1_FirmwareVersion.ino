  Using the ARGOS ARTIC R2 Breakout

  Date: November 12th 2020

  This example begins (initializes) the ARTIC breakout. The pin numbers are passed to begin.
  Begin takes care of setting the PWR_EN pins to enable power for the ARTIC and the RF Amp.
  Begin also controls the BOOT pin and downloads the firmware to the ARTIC.
  Begin returns true if the firmware checksum is valid.

  The ARTIC firmware version is read and printed to Serial.

  Hardware Connections:
  This example assumes the ARTIC Breakout has been mounted on a SparkFun Thing Plus - Artemis:
